                    You don't need to have a 100-person company to develop that idea. A quote by Larry Page that was justified when Plan2Hack, a 9-hour offline Hackathon and Business plan competition, was organized by BVPIEEE, the IEEE student branch of Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Engineering on 12th May 2022. Defying all odds and setting new trends, it got over 1000 registrations from all over India. Our generous sponsors helped us in generating a prize pool worth Rs 30,000.
                The entire event was organized by the dedicated team of BVPIEEE under the supervision of <b>Dr. Dharmender Saini (Principal, BVCOE)</b>, <b>Mrs. Yogita Arora (Branch Counselor, BVPIEEE) </b>.

The Event witnessed active participation from different parts of the country                
                The Judges for the event were <b>Akanksha Bhasin (Sr. Technical Community Evangelist, Symbl.ai) </b>,<b>Ravi Baranwal (Co-Founder UPEPO technology labs) </b>,<b>Preeti Rao (Founder & CEO, Weljii)</b>,<b>Dolly Chaudhary (GIS Manager in Agri- Tech Development with IFFCO Kisan)</b>,<b>Ankit Gupta (founder of SpaceStation Automation (SSA) Private Limited & its other Subsidiaries).</b>
                There were 3 rounds in all,  first one being the prototyping second the B plan and the 3rd  presentation.
                
                The top three teams who proved to be the best amongst the crowd—Dreamers, Phoenix and team Atom.ino.. This eventful day culminated with the fun-filled team photos, and this was how Plan2Hack , an event full of lessons and experiences ,  was successfully completed.

        <br><p> The tracks included various guest talks by industry professionals and academicians. Any technical conference is incomplete without hands-on experience of cutting edge technologies. The IBM Watson, Elastic Stack- Search, Kibana and Beats, and Fundamentals of Neural Networks’ based hands-on workshops ensured the highest level of attendee engagement during the conference. Attendees were also enlightened about internship opportunities offered by DeepSight AI Labs, SocialCops and Incuspaze from the organisations’ representatives. With 4 keynote sessions, 14+ guest talks, lightning talks, 3 workshops, resume booth, and the highly engaging panel discussion, InnoviCon turned out to be a delightful opportunity for students and professionals to gather valuable insights into the recent technological trends and network with fellow attendees.
