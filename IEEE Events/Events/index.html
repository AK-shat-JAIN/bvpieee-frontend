Biswas (IIT Delhi), Aravind Putrevu (Developer Advocate at ElasticSearch), Ankit Prasad (CEO, Bobble AI) and Janu Verma (Data Scientist at Hike) graced the occasion with their highly insightful keynote speeches. In addition to that, the conference had three parallel tracks – Fundamentals of AI, Applications of AI and Workshops. The tracks included various guest talks by industry professionals and academicians. Any technical conference is incomplete without hands-on experience of cutting edge technologies. The IBM Watson, Elastic Stack- Search, Kibana and Beats, and Fundamentals of Neural Networks’ based hands-on workshops ensured the highest level of attendee engagement during the conference. Attendees were also enlightened about internship opportunities offered by DeepSight AI Labs, SocialCops and Incuspaze from the organisations’ representatives. With 4 keynote sessions, 14+ guest talks, lightning talks, 3 workshops, resume booth, and the highly engaging panel discussion, InnoviCon turned out to be a delightful opportunity for students and professionals to gather valuable insights into the recent technological trends and network with fellow attendees.
